 * @example
 * Make sure to have build a pilet beforehand:

 * Then you should pack the current contents:

 * ```sh
 * pilet pack

 * Finally, you can publish it:

 * of the pilet in the browser.
 *
 * The selected schema version needs to be either "v0", "v1", or "v2".
 *
 * - v0: will download and evaluate the pilet explicitly
 * - v1: will use a script tag for integration of the pilet
 * - v2: will use SystemJS for integration of the pilet (default)
 *
 * The v1 version has better support for older browsers, but requires a polyfill to work
 * correctly. This polyfill is part of the standard Piral polyfills.
 *
 * The v2 version uses a SystemJS format for the pilet. It has the broadest browser support
 * but requires the custom format as output. Most bundlers support SystemJS directly or
 * indirectly, making it a quite broad choice.
